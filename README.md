Real-time Task Management Dashboard
You are tasked with developing a Real-time Task Management Dashboard
for a remote team using React and Express with WebSockets. The
dashboard should allow users to:
• Create, update, and delete tasks.
• Assign tasks to team members.
• Apply real-time updates when any user makes a change.
• Implement different UI themes using styled-components or Tailwind
CSS.
• Use controlled components for form inputs and manage form states
effectively.
• Implement a notification system that alerts users of task updates
in real-time.
• Persist tasks using Express and WebSockets instead of REST API.
User Stories:

tasks with a title, description, deadline, and assignee so that
everyone can see and track them.

• Real-time Updates: As a team member, I should see updates

dark themes for better accessibility.

alerts when a new task is assigned to me.
